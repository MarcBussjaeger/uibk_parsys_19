latency_measurements:
	- linear trends
	- small sizes lead to lower latencies for 2 sockets w.r.t 2 nodes
	- large sizes lead to higher latencies __,,__
	- measurements are rather constant over time

bandwidth_measurements:
	- asymptotical behaviour for 2 nodes
	- peak for 2 sockets within about 0-2*1e6
	- small deviations for 2 sockets over time
