latency_measurements:
	- two different nodes:
		- linear trend
		- constant over time
	- two sockets one node:
		- constant over time
		- linear trend with one outlier at small sizes
		- small sizes have lower latency as two nodes case,
		  larger sizes have larger __,,__
	- two cores one socket:
		- similar to two socket case


bandwidth_measurements:
	- two different nodes:
		- asymptotical behaviour (limit of bandwidth)
		- constant over time except for one outlier
	- two sockets one node:
		- peak for around 1e6
		- small deviations for over time
	- two cores one socket:
		- similar to two sockets case
		- slightly lower bandwidths
